# Door-Hanger-App
Desktop application for utility companies to notify delinquent customers.

This application was created to help water and sewer utility companies post nicely printed door hanger lables for the customers that are about to have their utility services terminated due to non payment of the bill. The program imports data from a text file. Then it allows the user to add mark the accounts that need to have labels printed. Then there is a first notification lable printed. Another text file can be imported that has removed the users who have paid their bills and updates the amounts currently oweing for others. Now the user can go through again and select the users who will have their service interrupted. When the user prints labels there are also reports that are generated listing all the information on the printed labels.

The labels are printed with Microsoft word. The data is stored locally with LocalDB.
